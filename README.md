### Hi there 👋

<!--
**dklymenk/dklymenk** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->

I am sorry, but there is nothing partucularly impressive here as I only use GitHub for collaboration on projects hosted on the platform or if I plan on taking advantage of a rather generous GitHub Actions free tier for public repositories.

That said, I have one project here that you might find worthwhile - [warcrime](https://github.com/dklymenk/warcrime) and it's accompanying [warcrime-api](https://github.com/dklymenk/warcrime).

If you are looking for more of my codes, please check out my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dklymenk).
