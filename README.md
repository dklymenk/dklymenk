### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**dklymenk/dklymenk** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

There is nothing partucularly impressive here as I only use GitHub for collaboration on projects hosted on the platform or if I plan on taking advantage of a rather generous GitHub Actions free tier for public repositories.

That said, I have one project here that you might find worthwhile - [warcrime](https://github.com/dklymenk/warcrime) and it's accompanying [warcrime-api](https://github.com/dklymenk/warcrime-api).

If you are looking for more of my codes, please check out my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dklymenk).

I also invite you to take a look at [my personal website](https://dmytro.klymenko.xyz). It features a list of projects that includes personal ones as well as volunteering contributions and some of my commercial work.
